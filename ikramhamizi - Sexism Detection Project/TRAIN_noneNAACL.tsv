a kickstarter is tempting. but i'm just so weird about money. i still feel kind of squick about my patron tbh. blame foss mentality.
i have so many ideas and so little time, even doing this full time. 90% of what i'm doing is talking to people.
i'm slowly finding people that i trust, but it's all so hard because i care *so much*.
@girlziplocked @doubleunionsf not yet. i should.
@sstwinrova i need to sit down with one and figure out how to be a better pm at my life. ;)
@sstwinrova i'm still at the stage where i've given up on finding a good task list mgt app that fits with my workflow, so i use a notepad.
@girlziplocked @doubleunionsf the difficulty is finding time to find those allies while figuring out what to do with the ones i've got.
it is not a block bot it is a tool to share block lists, this particular one being generated via the api and comparisons ffs. @alexlifschitz
i will burn the building down.
@girlziplocked @doubleunionsf i have... a whiteboard. and a mental list that i run through several times a day. i don't know pm stuff yet.
maybe i should put together a press kit.
what is a press kit? how do i build one?
@nebrius i think so :(
@nebrius are the responses bad? i've got the block list enabled, so i see nothing.
@allanschumacher @tha_rami yeah, this is more activist specific. less time talking to press, more time writing code.
@almafeta i think women in general have issues talking about money for activism. lots of articles on this.
@almafeta i've read many of them, but it doesn't make it easier for me.
i was looking for a specific video by @femfreq so i searched "anita sarkeesian" on youtube. good grief. so many angry manchildren.

@bard_of_peace but those tweets worry me. i don't want people thinking that. and i'm not sure how to fix it.
@bard_of_peace if you have ideas, i'd love to hear them. all i know how to offer is - if you get lots of shit, let me know?
@bard_of_peace indeed. some people are perhaps a bit more protective in that regards than i would like.
@bard_of_peace i'm lucky in that i have some of those people, too. i'm learning to walk away when i get a bit *too* impassioned, though.
@bard_of_peace it helps remembering how many eyes are watching - not gg, but msm, people i admire, companies. the npo depends on me.

@korvys @jonrosenberg i had to source *many* gater's timelines. the grammar wasn't good enough for it to work well with just one. seriously
@korvys @jonrosenberg and i can make that markov bot fight with my markov bot on command - watch https://t.co/fhxgthlab4
@jonrosenberg my markov bot was also on buzzfeed - it catches a lot of gaters. http://t.co/6ngtaodzyv
@jonrosenberg they are both pretty entertaining to talk to sometimes. ;)
@jonrosenberg the fight between both of them will keep going until i stop it, or until the script restarts when pulling in a new cache (1d)
@jonrosenberg if you follow, they follow back - and then randomly rt/fav your stuff if they like it. it's weird.
@jonrosenberg gater_ebooks is very fond of patreons.
@gater_ebooks tell me what you think about ethics
@gater_ebooks the ethics policy for gamergate doesn't exist.
attn all: i'm taking down @randi_ebooks/@gater_ebooks for maintenance tonight for <1hr. block lists will still function, just not markov.
putting them both on the same app secret/key (just diff user creds), adding more sources for gater_ebooks, doing some filesystem cleanup.
i want more than 5 private repos in github gdi.
i need to just switch to an organization-based github, but i don't want to pay $25/month because i'm cheap. :\
@ralphtice sticking to github for now. i need to stick with orgs where i know i've got internal contacts for abuse related things.
need github, but ty anyways. :)
@onebrightlight yeah. the name of the game lately is staying one step ahead of gater's attempts to shut things down/abuse the system.@onebrightlight github has been great for that. love them.
@gevmage sorry, need to stick to github. :)
@mvelic hehe. i'm used to copying a status url and pasting a lot. :p love all of the responses i get, though. ty for the idea. :)
@onebrightlight i've been talking to 2 employees and i heard about a lot of the internal politics re: gg. it's enough to make me stay.
@onebrightlight they made mistakes in the past. i hope they've learned. but the way they treated the gg situation has been outstanding.

@p8952_ @mjg59 it goes both ways. this is from a very limited sample size - people are far less likely to harass on fb w/real names.
@p8952_ @mjg59 but i've only discussed with other members of targeted harassment from this specific group. can't speak for other hate groups
@p8952_ @mjg59 the fact that twitter makes it easier to interact with those you're not connected to may have more to do with this.

@m1sp hey, do you have a good way to consume multiple json dumps into a single corpus? i've been just hacking it together.
@m1sp er, into a single model i mean. from multiple corpuses. or whatever.
@vex0rian @m1sp i thought it was looking at tweet ids or dates. i'm pulling from multiple user accounts.
@vex0rian @m1sp oh i just saw the latest version has consume-all (but help docs are bugged, btw.)
@vex0rian @m1sp consume_all vs consume-all, doesn't mention model name must be first.
@vex0rian @m1sp yeah, i made a *bunch* of changes with the old ver, nice to see some of them aren't needed anymore. :)
@vex0rian @m1sp i had a bunch of commands to help manage ggautoblocker related stuff. :) also started fights between randi/gater_ebooks
@vex0rian @m1sp it's a nice update! i quite like it.
devopsing so hard right now. http://t.co/sqz1otvsdc
@gregtheterrible in web, yes. clients other than web immediately delete tweets.
@gregtheterrible you should read the developer policy irt deleted tweets. it should comfort you ;)
@dilettante thanks ;) more fun stuff coming soon.
i hate configuring retention policies and flush intervals in statsd/graphite. ughhhh.
can i make graphite show the sum of 5m when retention is 1m? want to see a graph with point every 5m with sum of that time period.
@informationchef i have no idea what these mean: requestcontext, serieslist. guessing intervalstring would be 5m?
@informationchef i haven't really had to go plonking around in graphite before. this stuff is practically a foreign language.
@informationchef hmm. using grafana, and it's giving me errors.
@informationchef summarize(stats.counters.tweetstats.hashtag.all.count,'5m','sum')
been doing things. going to have some pretty automated stuff to show you all soon, but for now, some kinda neat stuff i found.
disclaimer: none of these things i'm about to tell you are 100% accurate. just *mostly* accurate. there are always exceptions.
in the past 12 hrs, gg hashtag saw 1018 tweets/hr (776 of which were rts). min: 662 (473) max: 1519 (1233). majority of non-rt came from bot
this is followed not-so-closely by @femfreq, with 80 (44 oc/36 rt) gg hashtagged tweets mentioning her. better luck next time.
rt @eksith: @feministspanker @freebsdgirl "could've fooled anyone!" was this too subtle? http://t.co/u04k34fwj0
literally #devops
the goal here is to eventually have up a pretty dashboard where you can go and see up-to-the-minute stats on this stuff.
i'm starting to get a grasp for when the notification ugliness is going to happen, so it could be an interesting incident notification tool.
however, it doesn't scale. i can use this to track up to a certain number of users. if they target a user i'm not looking at, won't work.
it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs, i guess, and *.wsp files that are deleted if they aren't updated in n minutes?
but that seems gross, and not really how this tool should be used. can do better w/other things, this is more for an overview.
@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i got statsd/graphite working on freebsd once, but then i switched to connected line graphs and it crashed?!
@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i don't wanna devops this. i just want it to work so i can do other things. i need a devops.
@cheeseplus yeah. i'm kind of feeling like for what i'm doing, wsp is ok. for doing more granular monitoring, redis would be good.
@cheeseplus no pretty graphs easily generated out of redis, tho. i'd have to learn r or somesuch.
@sir5000 @stormsonsaturn oh dear
@sir5000 @stormsonsaturn no. something went awry, box ran out of memory. it's also a dev box.
@sir5000 @stormsonsaturn looking into it, ty for the headsup.
@vex0rian @sir5000 @stormsonsaturn yeah, i've got a cron to kick it. it must not be kicking it properly.
@vex0rian @sir5000 @stormsonsaturn or it's not responding to kill signals. weeeeird. because i ran the script manually and it worked.
@vex0rian @sir5000 @stormsonsaturn getting into inst is slow. it's oomed. prob going to have to aws console and kick it.
@ctmf they are already setting up bots to tweet with the hashtag to inflate it. i don't really see this making much of a difference.
@ctmf but if they do, i'm happy to turn my graphs over to twitter's abuse department. i don't think the people i'm watching would risk that.
@faythemage @motavate i love those too much. too much.

@rachellite why would it?
@sschinke @tsundererager unclear. tos prevents bots from being able to contact you without you contacting them first, iirc.
@sschinke @tsundererager automated programs, whatever. it's not clearly written.
@gemmanoon it's what i'm *trying* to do, at least targeting specific groups/causes. it's tricky. have to look more at statistics than words.
@gemmanoon ie: things not as open for interpretation, such as numeric or boolean data (is following/is not following, etc).
@gemmanoon it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups. i think it'll be useful.
@gemmanoon rather amused that despite their protests, gg is the only group i've looked at where abuse is easily predicted based on followers
@sschinke @tsundererager previous versions of ebooks_example (code using twitter_ebooks) wouldn't reply to *_ebooks accounts.
@sschinke @tsundererager the latest version doesn't take this into account, iirc. i just added it to my custom bot blacklist.
@rachellite oh, they are. they didn't hurt after the first day or two.
verified accts for all is an ok idea, but too much administrative overhead. there are better ways, which i've talked about in the past.
verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.
however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients.
the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata.
add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update, natch).
does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than n days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update.
phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from gv), but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse.
in short, there needs to be a verified that isn't verified. requiring govt ids will cause probs. unique phone less problematic, not perfect.
don't worry, i'm sure no one will be like "what a great idea" until a dude takes credit for it. <3
@tomdcc a lot of people don't have cell phones. i was one of them for 2 years. ;) i only used gv. against the idea of disallowing gv.
@tomdcc not everyone can afford cell phones. gv is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing.
@dominictarason i was talking to twitter about it a few weeks ago, talked about it here a month ago (neener). :p
@edroach unaware of their issues. do they not have cell phones/access to gv?
@edroach i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for sms.
@edroach @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required.
@tomdcc it's very easy to change your gv #.
it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity.
pseudonyms are good. own it! anonymous is not the same thing. what jason/wadhwa are promoting would require id/home address/pay to use
go figure that silicon valley circle jerk elite don't realize that some people can't afford $10/month to not be harassed.
*whispers* hey guys. being free from abuse/harassment doesn't have to be monetized. it should be for everyone. i can show you the way.
take off your vc fedoras and think about what this really is. it's about the right that anyone has to not be harassed & threatened.
so, my yammering sleazeball cupcakes, you can go with http://t.co/tdtoqiuqdc and i'll go my way.
i fight for the users.
@teh_maxh you don't have to have a phone to get sms. you have to have internet. which is also required for twitter.
@edroach @twitter the number doesn't have to be stored to be ensured unique...
@edroach @twitter think about how passwords work. are they stored in plaintext? can the provider easily decrypt them? nope.
@tomdcc oh god that sounds like a horrible idea. privacy problems. also, twitter likely wouldn't be storing the number. that would be bad.
i'm still entertained that jason's idea is to either pay a fee or make your acct protected. i'd love to hear his thoughts on short skirts.
@edroach i think we shouldn't make assumptions if they are used in this manner, which is diff from their original purpose.
@teh_maxh still extra work to go through. most trolls move on and find new victims.
@dylanw last i checked, baldwin was verified.
@tomdcc you can only have one gv # per acct at any given time.

@limbclock i wouldn't do that.
@sschinke @teh_maxh what are you talking about?
@tomdcc i met with them weeks ago. :p who knows what they might do? i certainly don't. but we're talking.
@sschinke @teh_maxh it sets a bad precedent.
@sschinke @teh_maxh as a guess, anyways.

@seanbonner a low userid doesn't give you any special insight from atop a pulpit of privilege. abuse-free living shouldn't have a premium.

@seanbonner ideas and observations that are completely dismissive of those in a low income bracket.
@seanbonner not to mention poverty levels in some other countries, where this amount would be insurmountable. or what about teenagers?
@seanbonner @metsfan anything that requires a government id is a privacy concern. anything that requires money is a bad idea forever.
@seanbonner i'm trying to have a conversation. why do you think it's a fight?
@seanbonner just because i disagree with you doesn't mean i have strong feelings about you. i just dislike your solution.
find the problems w/dude's solution, don't publicly call him out, get accused of "trying to pick a fight" when i ask him about it. shocking.
why do dudes have to play the "you're not serious, just wanting to fight" card when women call them out on solutions with ill consequences?
given that he already used his low twitter userid to brag about his worth, i shouldn't be shocked that he wants twitter to be classist.
oh. he's also got ties to jason. lol. okay, then. basically a waste of anyone's time that isn't a white cishet male.

it's tough deciding how much of my personal story to relate when giving a short keynote about the present state of anti-harassment efforts.
i've seen support from places i didn't expect when i originally posted my story "still here", and i think that's important to point out.
we mostly hear about harassment in the context of gamergate, but that's a very narrow focus and not the real problem.
@tristanparrish i find more impactful talks are based around a story, but it's a tough balance.
woman dev audience. i think the real msg i want to get across is that anyone can make a difference. even with just a 200 line perl script.

how to be completely useless and be a butthead all in one tweet. https://t.co/l8znnd9uxm
@dylanw cool beans. useful info after a public callout.
@dylanw i did that after he dismissed me & my concerns as "argumentative". might wanna check the time stamps.
@dylanw that's cool. next time when a woman talks to him about how his approach is classist, he might want to not completely dismiss her.
@dylanw i didn't come at this looking to attack him. he's the one that told me to piss off.
@dylanw i'm sorry you don't have any time, that sucks. but next time you might want to look further before useless vague callouts.
@dylanw not publicly, and only to him. that's not an insult. he's the one that referenced it near the top of his blog post.
@dylanw i get that you're probably going to defend your friend regardless, but what he did was shitty, and then you followed it w/more shit.
@dylanw calling me out in that manner was poo-flinging, without any reference of *why*. it was totally useless and provoking. good job.
@dylanw i'm not responsible for his hurt feelings when he's the one that decided to ignore me instead of having a conversation.
@dylanw his behavior - and yours, for that matter - are pretty typical. sorry if the truth hurts.
@dylanw also, from a fellow sj to another, "butthurt" is generally frowned upon as a descriptor.
@dylanw fwiw, wasn't meant as a dig. i didn't know this until a few months ago when it was pointed out to me.

@atonal440 @ralphcrafts i'm pretty entertained in that i only see half of the conversation. ;)
@eevee @manami_fox @femfreq that has got to be one of the weirdest insults i've ever seen slung by an mra/gater/whatever.
@proon i would rather have teeth pulled.
@thatjesuss do you know this person? i don't generally promote fundraisers for legal fees for people i don't know/haven't talked to.
@mechmk1 why would you do that? :p these lectures are about freebsd.
@agqueue uh.
someday, a gater will have an epiphany regarding the definitions for dos/ddos. this unbelievable feat will be a sign of the apocalypse.
i don't understand why a simple technical definition is giving them so much of a problem. they seem to think dos/ddos == excessive packets.
dos/ddos doesn't refer to a technique or method of transport.
it's largely defined by intention + end result.
this is not rocket surgery.
if you want, you can classify an influx of notifications (dogpile!) as unintentional ddos, as it makes core functionality unusable to you.
it's super common to run into an unintentional dos, especially in dev. ever make a stupid mistake that caused a critical lack of resources?
maybe your program forked until it could fork no longer, and you didn't have restrictions on. maybe you sent an inappropriate amount of udp.
will the dev that has never forgotten to put in sleep statements or increment counters or wrote a poorly designed loop please stand up?
@coconono there's no hard definition of what constitutes dos beyond lack of service. service is open to mean many things.
@coconono remote servers, the programs listening on those servers, a local app...
@brianfenton did you just try to mansplain perl to me and fail?

out of pravana blue. guess i'm stuck with mixing some clear with special fx turquoise to layer over existing hair. hmm. this might be good.
existing *dye*. derp.
@youfoundthecard @chriswarcraft gross. netware.
@a_man_in_black well actually i'm kiiiiiiiinda a rainbow haired expert.
@a_man_in_black in all seriousness, i've been dying my hair since my teens. i can't remember the last time i used a single shade. too flat.
@elisarockdoc works well for some colors. the pastels are gorgeous but fade super quickly. the blues are amazing.
@milfgaardian depends on shade. when doing blues, most mp fades out greyish blue, most sfx fades out w/green tint.
@milfgaardian i usually mix brands depending on how they fade. sfx has fantastic pinks, though. n'rage does some decent pinks, too.
@a_man_in_black gross. i'd look weird with no hair.
@milfgaardian have you tried pravana?
@milfgaardian pravana blue - not pastels - mixed with a touch of purple to make the fade gorgeous + pravana clear. i swear by it.
@milfgaardian it's relatively new. most salons have switched to using it here instead of specialfx.
@milfgaardian (brb, am starting to feel feelings in my scalp, that means it's time to wash this stuff out.)
@milfgaardian not sure. i kind of like when it fades on short hair, if it's dyed well. it's less monotone.
@milfgaardian check it - https://t.co/bcdyxqzam7
@milfgaardian pravana vivids are my favorite line for blues, easily. pastels line is gorgeous, but fades so quick. days to weeks.
@milfgaardian pravana pastel pink fade after 14 days. the rest was originally mint colored. completely gone. http://t.co/v2uqo3male
@milfgaardian n'rage pink after ~1 week, turquoise is a mix of special fx. nrage pink holds very well. http://t.co/mqx0jzsilp
@milfgaardian i tend to document my hair color experiments for later. >.> that pigtails pic is a few years old.
@salvodan er, manic panic existed in the 90s.
what's the difference between drunk perl and sober perl?
drunk perl has comments.
@youfoundthecard @chriswarcraft i'm not as young as you think i am :p
funny dev joke, y/n? my sense of humor is weird.
i'm working on a new project, video about harassment, & i need your help. need vid clips of ppl reading an abusive tweet they've received.
just the content of the tweet, not the name of the person that sent it. pref with a screenshot.
goal is to show people irl reading the words they've received on the internet. this has impact.
@ronbasler yes. i will be censoring the names.
.@carolinesinders email vid to randi@randi.io, share on dropbox, amy file share service, whatever you prefer.
@minorannoyance @jimmykimmellive yup.
@youfoundthecard indeed. but i've been coding since 1987 ;) was still around for some of that fun. used to work on really old unixes, too.
.@pdlmma just general abuse. not necessarily gamergate specific.
@kencf0618 being blocked isn't harassment.
@pdlmma thanks ^.^
@thatmariorivera ty!
@argonblue my perl is pretty readable. not as efficient, necessarily, but definitely possible for anyone to read & understand.
@davidsgallant this weekend would be cool.
@davidsgallant thursday would be even better. ^.^
@kencf0618 i can never tell anymore. :p
@kencf0618 asking people to read some of the shit they've received and provide a video of themselves doing so is no small thing.
@jules_clarke @jmcefalas has more emotional impact when it's the face of a person reading it out loud.
@youfoundthecard ?
rt @desertfox899: @freebsdgirl
thought you might find this amusing. http://t.co/c4pttn6hih
it's pretty funny that gamergate thinks i'm profiting from harassment. i took a *huge* pay cut by going full time with this. @desertfox899
@argonblue what's funny is that i was drunk when i wrote it - and i wrote it for myself, not as something i planned on sharing.
@atonal440 @desertfox899 i'm not actually a dev. i'm devops. i like doing things that i find interesting. this is interesting. ^.^
@xrainbowcutiex not sure. i didn't see it.
i just got mad at my hair so i cut it.

ughhh. someone offered me a discounted all access gdc pass, but it's still more than i can afford.
.@georgieonthego go ahead. i'd be interested in seeing what you fabricate. hopefully they will be more creative than your "articles".
.@georgieonthego until now, i've never talked to you. but i'm sure you won't let a little thing like truth stand in the way of a story. ;)
@mrthegeoff @athenahollow sure!
it is weird that someone from gamergate would be opposed to a video *not specific to gamergate* talking about harassment. so weird, right?
i mean, why would gamergate care about a video where people read the abusive tweets they've received? what does this have to do with ethics?
i keep hearing that gamergate is opposed to harassment. i must be misunderstanding something, surely.
oh, wait. i take it back. i made a mistake. i mentioned @georgieonthego once before. https://t.co/1p46fj7kpx

rt @sakjur: @freebsdgirl haha, have you seen the tweets they're linking as harassment? https://t.co/ybxxzqlikl hilarious!
it's pretty funny that georgie claims i harassed her. never talked to her until last night, ignored the smear "article" she wrote. @sakjur
iirc she claimed i went to jail for drugs or something. i didn't read it. she's just trying to make a name for herself w/tabloidism @sakjur
pssst. @georgieonthego. https://t.co/mfptkyvql8 - this isn't ethical journalism. it never happened. ed isn't a reliable source. <3
spreading rumors started by gnaa as fact when you call yourself a journalist is why i can't take you seriously. @georgieonthego
that was fun. now it's over. this is why i can't even consider sites like techraptr as anything more than hit piece blogs.
@sschinke @georgieonthego she's claiming i threatened to sue her. it's *hilarious*. even with an obvious case of libel, who has the time?

feeling kind of fantastic after standing on a stage to tell (& show) people my experiences being harassed as a vocal woman in tech.
talked about weev & full disclosure mailing list post. baph doxxing, swat threats. family & friends being threatened. being target of a mob.
it was difficult. i questioned if it was a good idea until someone in the crowd came forward for a hug & started crying. then i was crying.
then q&a for both of us keynote speakers got hijacked to show harassment happening live. both of us talked about diff aspects of harassment.
talked about the need for support, mentors. people that understand because they've been through it all, too.
i was blown away. i couldn't even think of a more impactful way of getting across the point that this is a problem we need to talk about.
thank you to everyone at #girldevweek for the kind words. thank you for letting me speak. thank you for listening.
almost crying. but not quite. i have something in my eye, okay?
will make a blog post out of the contents of talk + slides (which are limited, i prefer not using slides)

@matt_cooke86 nutrition is key to closing the .#aboriginal life expectancy gap http://t.co/ihtnirjma9 @croakeyblog http://t.co/ktnqad0tm3
stuffing up instant couscous should be an immediate elimination.
i'm wrong, that show could get worse
if someone has to get the highest score in history:
it better be eva & debra or sherie & emilie.
"we are losing our mum and dad.."
they say they liked the mains but they haven't eaten anything on their plates. #sayforthesakeofsaying

rt @finicalgal: and a 7 for "smear of lemon tart"???
hope you do okay xd looks like youll do good
rt @peteevansnot: there still trying to figure out if 57 is more than 46 or not.
and a 7 for "smear of lemon tart"???
a 7? for unboned spatchcock and instant couscous?
if tony & lynn are eliminated, they should just burn the set like the house in what's eating gilbert grape?
yeah like you don't all know how it goes
i'm happy when life hands me lemons. can't do shots of tequila with artichokes.
pretty sure they're hiding any ability to actually cook.
i still refuse to believe that his real name is drasko!
rt @finicalgal: note: in a spatchcock dish, the pomegranate being the "star of the dish" is not a good thing.
worst!! actually wanted to throw my remote at my tv after that score!! shitty strategic score you witch!! #cheats #unfairscore
ok - get this off my fb page asap!
"we're about to turn the heat right up! with another instant restaraunt round!"
all of that is on tomorrow? ... wow, it's going to be a long episode!
have fun with your ratings fall
i dont know how i feel this way...
you haven't actually "sold out" if you're not charging for the food. (though you have sold out metaphorically.)
fingers crossed it tastes good."
"we're in our element serving food we've cooked.which turned out a whole lot better than plan a: serving food someone else had cooked."
i've never liked maple syrup with bacon. it ruins two great ingredients.
i think maybe the "hat" is turning people off.
"isn't raw egg in tomato poured onto a plate better than nothing?" no. just no.
and your back's against the wall, who ya gonna call...
