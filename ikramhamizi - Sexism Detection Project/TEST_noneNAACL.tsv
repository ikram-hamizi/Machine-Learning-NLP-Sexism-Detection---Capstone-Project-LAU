wadhwa thinks women only disagree vocally with him because they want "attention". #stopwadhwa2015
wadhwa had other women write a book about being a woman in tech, then he published it with his own name on the title. #stopwadhwa2015
wadhwa only cares about wadhwa - not women in tech. #stopwadhwa2015
rt @auragasmic: wadhwa is like most male "allies" who use women's suffering for their own financial & career advancement #stopwadhwa2015

@denniscearl have been traveling. barely managing cfps, blogs out of the question
wadhwa started contacting journalists that follow me on twitter to tell them how disappointed he is in them. #stopwadhwa2015
wondering if there would be value in refusing to answer inquiries/provide quotes for press that insists upon quoting wadhwa. #stopwadhwa2015
on one hand, he could get quoted more. but some reporters will look pretty dumb if all their women in tech stories are 100% about dudes.
@ncweaver i've ran into difficulties getting them to respond. which is weird. their news orgs have written stories about me in the past.
@ncweaver i'm guessing they are just used to tuning out complaints.
rt @ladyfleur: i am a woman in tech. vivek wadhwa does not speak for me. http://t.co/2bv5zlbmir #stopwadhwa2015
#stopwadhwa2015 because he is developing ties to gamergate. relies on their support, talks to milo.
#stopwadhwa2015 because he follows a pathetically low amount of female engineers. but he's cool with female reporters.
@verywhiteguy @me you can just do that with twitter search. unless you are looking to not block manually. ez enough to write, though.
the best thing @wadhwa could do for women in tech is leave them the hell alone, creeper. #stopwadhwa2015
watching @wadhwa claim that he never received financial compensation. oh, sweets. we know this isn't how that works. #stopwadhwa2015
money is the smallest part of success in tech. it's about accomplishment, connections, and rep - all of which wadhwa hides from women.
yeah, i've got a bit of a rageboner. mentally speaking.

gamergate = youtube comments as a service
pause in horror as you realize the harsh reality of that statement.
i'm not going to comment on if cernovich bought his followers. we don't know. it's speculation.
he stated in the past that people had bought him followers to try to get his account in trouble.
yes, a lot of his followers are bots. we have known this. this isn't news.
but saying that he did this is not okay. we don't know. we will probably never know. don't be like them.
we already know his reach doesn't really extend beyond gamergate anymore. his follower count does not matter.

ur face is classified as a utility by the fcc.
gather round, kids. it's story time, brought to you by my good friend @jcmanous.
once upon a time, in a land far, far away, in the great state of georgia, yours truly worked with @jcmanous.
we parted ways, but stayed in touch throughout the years. he got swole while i went off and did my thing, writing perl, angering trolls.
this brings us to today, when the hero of this story, @jcmanous, was on a bus near uga. listening to his podcasts, doing his thing...
words were said. the gaters protested "free speech!" - alas, speech may be free, but not of consequences.
given that my friend is quite fit and these gaters were not, they quickly departed at the next stop, instead of "debating" further.
take heed, gaters. you're alone in the world in your campaign of hate. people will stand up to you. men and women will stand up to you.
