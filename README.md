# NLP-Sexism-Detection (Abstract)
Capstone Project 2019 - CSC599

A substantial amount of research in social sciences has been done in regards to hate speech and the forms of sexism. As Oxford dictionary defines it, sexism is the “prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex” (as mentioned in Jha & Mamidi, 2017). However, it also affects men, and largely, the LGBTQ community. This type of hate speech is also found in Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as Twitter, and little research is done on detecting its occurrences. The project’s objective is, therefore, to investigate the usage of Natural Language Processing techniques in detecting sexism. 

Tweets publicly available and annotated by Waseem and Hovy (2016) are used as a dataset for this purpose. The tweets are classified into “sexist” or “other” by using NLP techniques and comparing different classifiers (Decision Tree and SVM). SVM outperformed J48 with an accuracy of 80.3%, F1-score of 0.8, and a ROC area of 0.806. One limitation to the project is the challenge of using NLP techniques on informal text due to the spelling variations and dependence on language (Pitsilis et al. 2018). Another limitation is the misclassification due to subjective judgements of texts which are context-reliant. Finally, languages in general and hate speech evolve continuously and the training data needs to be modified accordingly.
